\section{Motivation}
We want to be able to write down functions defined on manifolds

\section{Properties of Eigenfunctions}
if $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $R^n$ then the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega)$ (follows from the spectral theorem on compact self-adjoint operators, applied to the inverse of the Laplacian (which is compact, by the Poincar√© inequality and Kondrakov embedding theorem))
