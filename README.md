Laplacian Eigenmaps
======

This is my first (of two) bachelor's thesis on Laplacian eigenmaps and focuses on 
[Belkin's work](http://web.mit.edu/9.520/www/spring08/Papers/Belkin-ML-04.pdf) and
its mathematical background. 

To do
-----
(in no particular order)
* find title
* try not to get too "talkative", it's a bachelor's thesis in _math_ after all!
* highlight connections of potential theory and complex analysis which should provide some insight why it may be seen as a generalization of the Fouriertransformation (if there's enough space left)
* highlight connections of Gaussian kernel and heat kernel (motivation for the weights in the discrete caseâ€”again: if there's enough space left)
* implement proposed algorithm in Python and compare results to those of other approaches
* decide how to introduce the Laplace operator (only for $R^n$ or more generally)
* finish it.
